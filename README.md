- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZeHide   
- 👀 I am interested in the development of programming in the full sense of the word programming. But mostly, so far, web-programming.
- I am currently learning the php programming language. Just like the whole principle of how web applications work.
- 💞️ I want to continue working with those who may want to help the young padawan master everything listed above, given that I have only been studying for a couple of weeks.
- If someone wants to contact me, then please use GitHub.
